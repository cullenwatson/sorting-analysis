**Sorting**<br>
CS 3353 - Spring 2022 - Programming Assignment 02

In this repo, I have implemented 6 sorting algorithms:

      ● insertion sort
      ● randomized quicksort
      ● merge sort
      ● shellsort
      ● introsort
      ● timsort
  
After implementing the algorithms, I collected data on each of them with string and integer arrays. There were 5 categories of testing data sets:

      ● 100% sorted
      ● 60% sorted
      ● 100% randomized
      ● 80% randomized
      ● 60% randomized
      
Under each of these categories, I created 5 sizes of arrays for each. For the integers, I used sizes: 1k, 10k, 100k, 250k, 500k, 6000k. <br><br>
For the strings, I used smaller datasets of 10, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000. The string datasets (available in rawstringdata.txt) were generated using a python script that utilized a random <br>
string generator, while the integer datasets were created during runtime with the use of for loops and the rand() function.
